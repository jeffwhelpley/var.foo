# var.foo

This is a fun app I created to try out Qwik and the latest Cloudflare tech.

The idea for this app is to give people a way to share things without creating an account. The concept is equivalent to when you want to prototype something in code and you just quickly type in `var foo = ` until you have more time to come up with a better name. In this case, you are setting `foo` to some files or perhaps ad hoc text. The var.foo app will save your values to a page with a unique URL that only you know and you can share with whoever you want.

It would be great to get contributions here and I welcome it, but it will take me a little time to set up all the standards and processes.

For now, just submit a pull request if you want changes and/or submit an issue if you find a bug.
